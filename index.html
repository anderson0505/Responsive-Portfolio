                <p>Hello, my name is Blane Anderson. I was born in the Chicago suburbs and moved to Kansas City, MO when I was
                    five. My father got a new job as a computer programmer and we had extended family on his side in that
                    area so we decided to seize the opportunity. I graduated from Lee's Summmit West High School and went
                    to Missouri State University immediately after. I earned a Bachelor's of Science degree in Economics.
                    Since then, I have moved to Phoenix, AZ where I have been living since 2013. I am making a career move
                    and currently taking a Coding Bootcamp through the University of Arizona where I will learn to become
                    a Full Stack Developer. I am excited for what lies ahead!
                    <br>
                    <br> The outdoors is something I really enjoy and being in Arizona there are many places to go see. I have
                    been to Slide Rock National Park, snowboarding in Flagstaff and Greer, and dirtbiking at more than 20
                    different trail systems. There are still many places to visit in Arizona and the surrounding states and
                    I look forward to visiting them soon!

                </p>
